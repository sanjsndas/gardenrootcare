At GardenRoot Care, we use cookies to enhance your browsing experience and to understand how our website is being used.</p>
                    <p>Cookies perform various functions, such as remembering your preferences, personalizing content, and analyzing site traffic. They help us improve our website by providing insights into which pages are most popular and how visitors navigate through our site. Some cookies are essential for the website to function properly, while others are optional and require your consent.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                    <p>We use several types of cookies on our website, each serving specific purposes. Strictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function and cannot be switched off. Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use our site, helping us improve it. Functionality cookies remember your preferences to provide enhanced features.</p>
                    <p>Targeting cookies are used to deliver content that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may be used to display targeted advertising or to limit how many times you see an ad. Social media cookies allow you to share content from our website on social media platforms and enable other enhanced social media features.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cookie-section">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These essential cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions made by you, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. Without these cookies, certain services you request cannot be provided.</p>
                    <p>For example, strictly necessary cookies might maintain your session as you move between pages, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, or keep items in your shopping cart. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information and are exempt from consent requirements under most privacy regulations.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Performance cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.</p>
                    <p>We use tools like Google Analytics to understand how our website is being used, which helps us make informed decisions about site improvements. These cookies help us identify pages with technical issues, determine the effectiveness of our content, and optimize our marketing efforts. If you do not allow these cookies, we won't know when you've visited our site.</p>

                <div class="cookie-section">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Functionality Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Functionality cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we've added to our pages. These cookies remember choices you make (such as your preferred language) and provide enhanced, more personal features.</p>
                    <p>For example, we might use these cookies to remember your login details, keep you logged in during your visit, remember your preferences for text size or colors, or provide services you've asked for like watching a video. Without these cookies, certain features may become unavailable, but the website will still function.</p>

                    <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They work by uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.</p>
                    <p>We might use these cookies to limit how often you see an ad and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. While these cookies can track your visits to our site and other websites, they typically don't store personal information in a way that's directly identifiable. You have full control over whether to allow these cookies.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Social Media Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Social media cookies are set by a range of social media services that we've added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. These cookies are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests.</p>
                    <p>These cookies might be used to deliver personalized advertising on those social media platforms. The social media services may use this information for their own purposes, following their own policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these social networks for more information about how they process your data.</p>

                    <p>First-party cookies are set directly by GardenRoot Care when you visit our website. These cookies are essential for the operation of our site and help us provide you with the services you request. First-party cookies include both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device for a set period).</p>
                    <p>We use first-party cookies for various functions including securing your login session, remembering your preferences, and analyzing site performance.

                    <p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the website, deliver advertisements on and through the website, and so on. These cookies are set by domains other than our own and are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.</p>
                    <p>Examples include Google Analytics cookies, social media buttons, and embedded videos from platforms like YouTube. While we strive to work with reputable providers, we cannot control how these third parties use their cookies.

                    <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser's cookie file until you leave the site. These are typically used to maintain your session state as you navigate through our website. They allow us to link your actions during a browsing session but are erased when you close your browser.</p>
                    <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for the period specified in the cookie (from a few minutes to several years). These enable us to remember your preferences for future visits. Most persistent cookies will have an expiration date and will be automatically deleted when that date is reached, unless you delete them earlier through your browser settings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cookie-section">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">11. Cookie Duration</h3>
                    <p>Different cookies have different lifespans depending on their purpose. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for anywhere from a few hours to several years. The specific duration for each cookie is set when the cookie is created and depends on its function.</p>
                    <p>We regularly review our cookie usage and set appropriate expiration times based on the cookie's purpose. Essential cookies typically have shorter lifespans, while analytics and preference cookies may persist longer to maintain your settings across visits and provide accurate usage statistics.</p>
